I believe that I have everything working and that I have properly handled
when the table is larger than the screen size. I have changed the header
colors to help readability, and I attempted to use table-hover or
table-striped to also help with this, but I was unable to get them to work.
I also made this compatible with mobile devices to try and help with readability.
